README? Are you serious?

So there's a lot I would need to write and i'd rather spend the time now on dev.

For now, you can get what you can get at zfasel.com/ntlm.

Actually, the page might still be a 404 by the time you read this. It's all coming together quickly, but there's a lot to do solo.

Check out config.rb. To get started right away, connect to http://zf:zf@localhost:4531
